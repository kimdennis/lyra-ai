I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God
I feel so bad for the people who are trying to save me
But I'm starting to get a little bit of a conscience
And I feel bad about the way I've been treated

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You know what I mean? I ain't no rapper
No, I don't think I do
If I were to say I was a rapper, you'd think that I'd be
A rapper who's been around the block
Like, 'cause I got a rap sheet
That I wrote about, and I had a problem with it
So I just wrote it down, like, "I don' think it's fair to criticize you
